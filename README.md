This is a lite version of AlexGyver firmware for arduino.

## Short description::

The lamp on the address LEDs, allowing you to get beautiful glow effects:

Removed from the original:

- alarm clock;
- work with Wi-Fi (the arduinka does not have it);
- effect "Fireflies" - there was not enough space in RAM for it;
- What is added (oddly enough, but yes, there was something to add):


## v1.0
- 	the effect of "Fireflies" is replaced by "White Lamp";
- 	saving settings for all effects, including current mode in non-volatile memory. It is made five times by pressing a button, the confirmation will be turning off and on the lamp;
- 	adjusting the speed of effects by double-clicking and holding the button for a second press;
- 	adjusting the scale of effects by triple pressing and holding the button for the third press;
- 	indication of brightness / speed / scale with a vertical strip of red / green / blue, respectively;
